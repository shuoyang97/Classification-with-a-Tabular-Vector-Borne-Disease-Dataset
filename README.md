# Classification-with-a-Tabular-Vector-Borne-Disease-Dataset

# Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Vector Borne Disease Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance. Note that in the original dataset some prognoses contain spaces, but in the competition dataset spaces have been replaced with underscores to work with the MPA@K metric.

# Files

### train.csv - the training dataset; prognosis is the target
### test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict prognosis
### sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
